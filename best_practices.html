      <h1>Stop the Spread</h1>
      <p>
        <img alt="Close up of a hose" src="images/hose.jpg" class="right-image">Invasive species most commonly introduced and spread from human interactions with the ecosystem, often times on accident! Although we cannot turn back time and prevent the introduction of native species in Ohio’s native habitats, preventing the further spread of invasive species is crucial to maintaining our great state’s natural biodiversity and protecting native wildlife. Through collaborative effort and awareness, we can all do our part in ‘stopping the spread’. By taking proactive individual measures, we are ensuring we leave our ecosystem as is, or better yet, better than we found it!
<br><br> Here are some measures you can take to stop the spread:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Clean your boots</b> before and after you hike in a new area! Small invasive bugs and seeds can cling to your boots and be transported back home with you. Many parks provide boot prushes at the trailhead!</li>
        <li><b> Sourcing local firewood</b> is very important to preventing the spread of wood burrowing pests like the Emerald Ash Borer! Try to find firewood cut from your area. </li>
        <li><b>Check your boat</b> for any pests, including mollusks, barnacles, or seaweeds that may have attached themselves after you leave a waterway. This is especailly important if you plan to boat in multiple waterways! </li>
        <li><b>If you see it, report it!</b> Local conservation authorities may not be aware of invasives in your area. If a plant or organisim looks suspicius, send a report to the Ohio Department of Natural REcources or your cities conservation department!</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Taking any of these steps can make a huge impact! An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of intervention down the line. Check out our pages on species identification for more information on spotting invasives as they arise.  </p>

      <h1>At home</h1>
      <p> Invasives come in many forms. Some of the most common in Ohio include honeysuckle, zebra molusks, .......... For homeowners, they can pose a great risk to your properties biodiversity. In your own yard, you can take the following actions to combat and remove invasives: </p>
      <h4> Plant Local </h4>
        <p class="indent">Consult with your local nursery, the Ohio Department of Natural Recources, or other authority on what plants are local to your area as you are designing your garden. Avoid planting any species that could spread rapidly or hurt local wildlife!</p>
      <h4> Keep it On a Leash </h4>
        <p class="indent"> Keep pets on a leash when travelling. Pets with fur can pick up unwanted orgnaisms if left to run free and transport them back home. In addition, do not release any exotic pets, such as birds, reptiles, or rodents into the wild, as they can have devestating effects on local populations. </p>
      <h4>Identify and Remove</h4>
        <p class="indent">In your yard, keep an eye out for potentially invasive species. Invasives spread quickly, so remove them as soon as you see them start to pop up. Try to get all the way to the root to prevent further outbreaks.</p>
      <h4>Work with Intention</h4>
        <p class="indent">If you have a large crop of invasives in your yard, a forest of honeysuckle for example, work with intention when removing it. Start along the edges and work inward if possible to reduce hte spreadable surface area. </p>
      <h4>Monitor and Manage </h4>
        <p class="indent">After removing invasives, continue to monitor the area to make sure future outburts do not occur. Keep a close eye on wooded areas and lakes and ponds on your property, managing issues as they come up.</p>
